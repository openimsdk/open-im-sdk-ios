# iOS Client SDK for OpenIM üë®‚Äçüíªüí¨

Use this SDK to add instant messaging capabilities to your app. By connecting to a self-hosted [OpenIM](https://www.openim.online/) server, you can quickly integrate instant messaging capabilities into your app with just a few lines of code.

The underlying SDK core is implemented in [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core). Using [gomobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile), it can be compiled into an XCFramework for iOS integration. iOS interacts with the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core) through JSON, and the SDK exposes a re-encapsulated API for easy usage. In terms of data storage, iOS utilizes the SQLite layer provided internally by the [OpenIM SDK Core](https://github.com/openimsdk/openim-sdk-core).


## Documentation üìö

Visit [https://docs.openim.io/](https://docs.openim.io/) for detailed documentation and guides.

For the SDK reference, see [Quick Start guide](https://docs.openim.io/sdks/quickstart/ios).

## Installation üíª

### Adding Dependencies

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.5
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/bc1pjerry/open-im-sdk-ios.git", from: "4.0.0"),
    ]
)
```

## Usage üöÄ

The following examples demonstrate how to use the SDK. Objective-C is used, providing complete type hints.

### Importing the SDK

```swift
@import OpenIMSDK;
```

### Logging In and Listening for Connection Status

> Note: You need to [Deploy OpenIM Server](https://github.com/openimsdk/open-im-server#rocket-quick-start)  first, the default port of OpenIM Server is 10001, 10002.

```swift
OIMInitConfig *config = [OIMInitConfig new];
config.apiAddr = @"";
config.wsAddr = @"";
config.objectStorage = @"";

BOOL success = [OIMManager.manager initSDKWithConfig:config
                                        onConnecting:^{
    // The SDK is currently connecting to the IM server.
} onConnectFailure:^(NSInteger code, NSString * _Nullable msg) {
    // Callback function for connection failure
    // code: Error code
    // error: Error message
} onConnectSuccess:^{
    // The SDK has successfully connected to the IM server.
} onKickedOffline:^{
    // Kicked offline.
} onUserTokenExpired:^{
    // Token expired while online: In this situation, you need to generate a new token and then call the `login()` function again to log in.
}];
```

To log into the IM server, you need to create an account and obtain a user ID and token. Refer to the [access token documentation](https://doc.rentsoft.cn/restapi/userManagement/userRegister) for details.

### Receiving and Sending Messages üí¨

OpenIM makes it easy to send and receive messages. By default, there is no restriction on having a friend relationship to send messages (although you can configure other policies on the server). If you know the user ID of the recipient, you can conveniently send a message to them.

```swift
@import OpenIMSDK;

// Listenfor new messages üì©
[OIMManager.callbacker setAdvancedMsgListenerWithOnRecvMessageRevoked:^(OIMMessageRevokedInfo * _Nullable msgRovoked) {
} onRecvC2CReadReceipt:^(NSArray<OIMReceiptInfo *> * _Nullable msgReceiptList) {
} onRecvGroupReadReceipt:^(NSArray<OIMReceiptInfo *> * _Nullable msgReceiptList) {
} onRecvNewMessage:^(OIMMessageInfo * _Nullable message) {
}];

OIMMessageInfo *testMessage = [OIMMessageInfo createTextMessage:@"Hello!"];

[OIMManager.manager sendMessage:testMessage
                         recvID:@""
                        groupID:@""
                offlinePushInfo:nil
                      onSuccess:^(OIMMessageInfo * _Nullable message) {
            // Please note here that the returned message needs to be replaced with the data source.
            testMessage = message;
} onProgress:^(NSInteger number) {
} onFailure:^(NSInteger code, NSString * _Nullable msg) {
}];
```
